## Scenarios & Journey Map
### 1. Amy's Scenario & Journey Map

#### Why Amy is using this product
> Amy is about to graduate high school in three months, so she has been very focused on finding a career path that is right for her. Schooling has always brought Amy a lot of anxiety because she likes to produce work only when she feels motivated and creative, not when an assignment is due. Amy reached out to her favorite stylist known as styledbytati, securing herself an internship position with her over the summer. Amy needs to be able to drive for this intenship as she will be required to outsource clothing in multiple different locations. This is a dream position for Amy, motivating her to go on the New York DMV website and begin the process of obtaining her license.
#### How Amy is using this product
> Amy recieves an email from the stylist asking if she will be able to accept the position. Right as Amy gets home from school, she opens her laptop and goes to the New York DMV: Get a License page. She clicks on the blue rectangular button that says "Get a License" and she begins reading the step by step intructions. Using her notes app, she logs all the information relevant to her that she finds on the website. She writes that she needs a Class D license and that she needs to go to the DMV during operating hours to get a learners permit and pass the test. She then continues to read that she has to have supervised driving practice before she can take her actual driving test on the road. Amy then takes note of all the fees this process will take her. She clicks the blue hyperlink that states "estimate my fees," finding out that for her age range, all fees together excluding the supervised driving lessons will be between $92.50 and $102.50. Amy now calls a friend to give her a ride to the DMV so she can begin this process.
